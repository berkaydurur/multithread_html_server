# Multithread HTML Server
I created a basic HTML server with C. I used socket structure and pthreads for server. It can basically represent HTML, Text, PNG, and JPG files. This project was my semester project for System Programming lesson.

You need give a port that server will work on. In terminal you can start server with <code>/.path_to_compiled_file port_no</code>.
